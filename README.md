# Mateusz Pawlowski Portfolio

Hello current I am a university Student at Depaul University in my senior year. I am majoring in Information Technology. A couple of my hobbies are play video games, reading, hiking, coding, and hanging with my friends. This is my portfolio that I will be working on during the summer.

Currently I am just initializing all of my components, I will be using React to build this project of mine. Hopefully I will be doing constant updates for the projects.

This project uses the official React plugin for Vite:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.

## Layout Offsets

Spacing for the fixed clock bar, floating dock and footer is controlled by CSS variables in `src/index.css`:

- `--clock-bar-height`
- `--dock-height`
- `--dock-gap`
- `--footer-height`

Adjust these values to keep content from sitting underneath the fixed UI elements.
