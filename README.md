# Mateusz Pawlowski Portfolio

Hello current I am a university Student at Depaul University in my senior year. I am majoring in Information Technology. A couple of my hobbies are play video games, reading, hiking, coding, and hanging with my friends. This is my portfolio that I will be working on during the summer. 

Currently I am just initializing all of my components, I will be using React to build this project of mine. Hopefully I will be doing constant updates for the projects.

This project uses the official React plugin for Vite:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
